# TaskHub
A simple TODO Web App with dynamic task display and gamification. The app is created from HTML, CSS, and JS and contains two components: a task board and a scoreboard. The task board allows the user to add a task with a description and estimated time of completion upon which the task will be dynamically added to the current board. The size of the task and the points awarded for completing it are dependent on the time needed to complete it. The scoreboard displays the rank of the user compared to other users, which will be implemented in the future.
